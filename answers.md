What is the purpose of the various auxiliary methods populateList, populateFifoList, and ReverseLines.printReverse?

To add and print items to a list without using loops but using recursion instead

Why do these methods need to have arguments, and how does the argument change from one recursive call to the next?

Arguments are used to break down an object into its smallest form, which is recursion. The arguments change by calling the node with the next form in the order.   

What are the time and space complexity of each of the populateList populateFifoList methods, as well as ReverseLines.printReverse?

All are O(n).

Which of these methods can be implemented using while loops?

All can be implemented with while loops.
